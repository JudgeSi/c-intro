/**
	Memory

    	This section is about memory and goes into detail about variables, addresses and pointers.

	RAM (memory) is sepereated into different sections which are addessable.
	The value of a variable is the same as the value at a definitive address.
	Different types of data need a differently siced bytes to be saved, suchas:
		* boolean:  1 bit (0:=false, 1:= true)
		* char:     8 bit (the numbers (0..256) of which each number translates into exactly
				  one character. For instance [0:=a, 1:=b, 2:=c, .. ] )
		* int: 	   32 bit (the numbers (-32`000`000 - 32`000`00)

		TODO more types

  int i;
  // somewhere in memory a place is allocated which is big enough to store an int.
  // this place is the address of a: &a
  
  // unitialized values just contain a garbage value
  printf("This is the unitialized value i now %i \n", i); 
  // if we set a proper value it gets stored in i
  i = 1;
  printf("i equals %i now \n", i);  

  // this value is stored at somewhere in RAM. We can figure out the bytes required to store a value
  // through the sizeof(i); operation.
  long byteLengthForI = sizeof(i);
  printf("The size to store i is %li bytes \n", sizeof(i));

  // these bytes are located somewhere in memory. This location is called an address and is identitfied by the number of the starting byte.
  // With the &-opeator we can request the value of any address.
  printf("This is the location of i currently: %x \n", &i);

  // This value of an address is also called a pointer. 
  // In c we have a specific datatype for a pointer. Pointers are marked with a *
  // Furthermore a pointer must have a specific type to which it points.
  int *pointer = &i;
  printf("The value of this pointer is the same as &i: %x  \n", pointer);

  // ## Pointer Arithmethic

  // since pointers are just plain numbers for bytes in memory we can address anything we want in memory by just adding or subtracting from a pointer.
  // here we directly GOTO (*) to whatever is located directly at the pointer.
  printf("The first byte in i: %i \n", *pointer);
  // notice the brackets for proper GOTO statements.
  printf("The second byte equals: %i. It is located at: %x .\n", *(pointer +1), &*(pointer+1));
  printf("The second byte is located at %x that is %i bytes away from i. \n", 
	&*(pointer+1), (long)  &*(pointer+1) - (long) pointer);
  // So it appears the pointer arithmetic knows 4 bytes are takes by the int so adding 1 skips 4 bytes.
  //lets test this with longs, which require more bytes to validate.
  long l = 10;
  long *l_pointer = &l;
  printf("l is %i, the value is saved at adress %x adding one to pointer gives address: %x, that is %i bytes away. The same as the size required for the long (%i).\n",
	l, l_pointer, &*(l_pointer+1), (long) &*(l_pointer+1) - (long) pointer, sizeof(l));

  // ### Hacking memory
  // using this pointer arithmethic we can now very easily proce around in our memory and print out the values for arbitrary addresses.
  for(int j=0;j<15;j++)
  {     
	printf("we are at address %x the value at pointer + %i the stored valueis = %i\n", &*(pointer+j), j, *(pointer+j));
        if(&*(pointer+j) == l_pointer)
	{
	   printf("Did you notice? we just visited the byte-address which was used to save our long \"l\". it was located at: %x, lets try to print out the value as a long: %li \n", l_pointer, *(pointer + j));
	}
  }

  // this is also why we cannot store a number which is larger than an int in i.

  printf("Setting i to one-hundred-billion does not work: i = %i \n", i);

  /** These are pointers. Pointers  are a specific type of data, which point to a specific addressspace

	* Arrays A colletion of multiple addresses of the same type
	* Strings: Eine Sammlung mehrerer Char speicher adressen in einem Array
	* call by reference  
	* complex datatypes
	* dynamic memory usage
