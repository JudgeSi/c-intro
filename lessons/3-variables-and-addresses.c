/**
	Memory

    	This section is about memory and goes into detail about variables, addresses and pointers.

	RAM (memory) is sepereated into different sections which are addessable.
	The value of a variable is the same as the value at a definitive address.
	Different types of data need a differently siced bytes to be saved, suchas:
		* boolean:  1 bit (0:=false, 1:= true)
		* char:     8 bit (the numbers (0..256) of which each number translates into exactly
				  one character. For instance [0:=a, 1:=b, 2:=c, .. ] )
		* int: 	   32 bit (the numbers (-32`000`000 - 32`000`00)

		TODO more types

  // if we set a proper value it gets stored in i

  // through the sizeof(i); operation.
  long byteLengthForI = sizeof(i);
  printf("The size to store i is %li bytes \n", sizeof(i));

  // these bytes are located somewhere in memory. This location is called an address and is identitfied by the number of the starting byte.
  // With the &-opeator we can request the value of any variable.
  printf("This is the location of i currently: %x \n", &i);

  // This value of an address is also called a pointer. 
  // In c we have a specific datatype for a pointer. Pointers are marked with a *
  // Furthermore a pointer must have a specific type to which it points.

  // this is also why we cannot store a number which is larger than an int in i.

  // in memory. TODO is this like a number range? i.e. [x000000-x00000001] f√ºr ein bool? or just the
  // plain number. 
  // This data is just a number [0 - 64.000.000.000.000.000.000] (assuming 8 gigabyte RAM) of which 
  // each number points to specific bit in the address space.
 
 // Pointers serve to store:
	* Arrays A colletion of multiple addresses of the same type
	* Strings: Eine Sammlung mehrerer Char speicher adressen in einem Array
	* call by reference  
	* complex datatypes
	* dynamic memory usage
