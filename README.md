### C intro
> This intro are my uni notes for a c introduction course from the ["freitagsrunde" of the TU Berlin](https://wiki.freitagsrunde.org/C-Kurs_2013).

This is an introductory course for c. 
The concept of the course follows the concept of [this go intro course](https://gobyexample.com/), so far as the learnings and lessons are done directly in code with heavy documentation. Furthermore all code should be executable.

### sources
* ["freitagsrunde" of the TU Berlin](https://wiki.freitagsrunde.org/C-Kurs_2013)
* [Harvard CS-50 c intro course](). I heavily recommend this course, it is one of the most comprehensive introductions in a programming language I have found in recent times. The strength of this course is to close the gap between code abstraction and technical implementation by the computer.

### installation
c, gcc and make are required..
